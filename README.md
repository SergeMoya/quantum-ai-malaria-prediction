## Quantum-Inspired AI for Disease Outbreak Dynamics

### Task 1: Data Preprocessing
- Load datasets from the `data` folder.
- Clean missing values and normalize key features.
- Engineer features such as temporal trends and population density.
- Save processed data to `results/preprocessed_data.csv`.

### Task 2: Classical Model
- Train a classical machine learning model (Random Forest or Gradient Boosting).
- Evaluate model performance (RMSE, RÂ²) and save results to `results/classical_model_metrics.csv`.

### Task 3: Quantum-Inspired Model
- Implement a TensorNetwork-based AI model for time-series prediction.
- Compare performance against the classical model.
- Save predictions and metrics to `results/quantum_model_metrics.csv`.

### Task 4: Visualizations
- Generate:
  - Accuracy comparison plots.
  - Predicted vs. actual incidence trends.
  - Heatmaps showing risk regions.
- Save outputs to `visualizations/`.
